1) At least one two-level hierarchical object (e.g., a human arm).

The angler fireflies have antennae with two joints that move from side to side and up and down. They use it to attract prey.  

2) At least one texture, either procedural or mapped.

The sun, moon, lanterns...

3) Polygonal objects of your own (you must provide positions, normals, and texture coordinates directly, by extending the Shape class), drawn in different places using both flat shading and smooth shading variants of the Phong reflection model.

Custom polygons include the lanterns and the spikes of the comet. Two types of lanterns use flat shading and one uses smooth shading (the round one). 

4) Miscellaneous notes:

There's audio with the animation. It's called "Beethoven's Silence" by Ernesto Cortázar. Parts of the animation are synced to the music. 

Two minutes into the animation, the red firefly flies towards the moon.
